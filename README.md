# CritDeck
Discord bot for critical hit deck - this one https://nordgamesllc.com/product/critical-hit-deck-players-5e/. JSONified the cards - that was fucking boring. But the code was easy

To setup a bot follow steps on https://kavitmht.medium.com/discord-bot-in-go-74eabf4090a7

Run bot locally replacing Token with your bot token

Still needs more things. Like, lots more things. This shit has no damn error handling at all
